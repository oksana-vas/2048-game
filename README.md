## Game description

The game is played on a 4x4 grid, and the objective is to slide numbered tiles on the grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. Players can swipe in four directions (up, down, left, or right), and when two tiles with the same number collide as a result of the swipe, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values.

The game starts with two tiles, each having a value of 2 or 4, randomly placed on the grid. With each swipe, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears on the grid. The player continues to combine tiles and strategize their moves to reach the 2048 tile, and the game continues beyond that point for those who want to achieve higher scores.
